	<h1>Home</h1>
	<p> I'm a student at UC Berkeley majoring in Data Science and Economics. Currently, I teach as an undergraduate student instructor for DataC8, Foundations of Data Science. </p>
	<p> I have interned at EY as a tax, technology and transformation intern where I did work in tax, data science and data analytics.</p>
	<p> I have mastered Python, SQL and R, and continue to build my skills in machine learning. I aim to work for a company to better my technical abilities as well build my soft skills. I would love to be able to use my skills to contribute to missions for DEI and sustainability.</p>
	<p> When I'm not studying or working, you can find me looking for the next cafe/boba place to vists, playing cozy games like Stardew Valley, and spending time with my friends & family.</p>
